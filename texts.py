    # Welcome to PCPred!

    Our platform was created to make life easier for researchers
    and scientists working in drug development and other areas
    related to chemistry. With it, you can predict the physicochemical properties
    of molecules using traditional methods such as Joback[1-4], Machine Learning (ML) models[5,6].
    
    Completely free and easy to use, PCPred is your ideal tool to accelerate
    discoveries and reduce research time.

    Main features:
    - Drawing of chemical molecules directly in the interface
    - Prediction of properties such as boiling point, pKa and Gibbs Energy
    - Use of methods such as Joback and Machine Learning models for greater accuracy

    How to use:
    1. Go to the `Predictor` section.
    2. Draw your molecule or enter the desired Smiles.
    3. Click the `Make Prediction` button to view the properties.
